                        <h2>First mechanical computer or automatic computing engine concept</h2>
                    </header>
                    <p>
                        In 1822, Charles Babbage conceptualized and began developing the Difference Engine,
                        considered to be the first automatic computing machine. The Difference Engine was capable
                        of computing several sets of numbers and making hard copies of the results.
                        Babbage received some help with development of the Difference Engine from Ada Lovelace,
                        considered by many to be the first computer programmer for her work and notes on
                        the Difference Engine. Unfortunately, because of funding, Babbage was never able
                        to complete a full-scale functional version of this machine. In June of 1991,
                        the London Science Museum completed the Difference Engine No 2 for the bicentennial
                        year of Babbage's birth and later completed the printing mechanism in 2000.

                        In 1837, Charles Babbage proposed the first general mechanical computer,
                        the Analytical Engine. The Analytical Engine contained an Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU),
                        basic flow control, punch cards (inspired by the Jacquard Loom), and integrated memory.
                        It is the first general-purpose computer concept. Unfortunately, because of funding issues,
                        this computer was also never built while Charles Babbage was alive. In 1910, Henry Babbage,
                        Charles Babbage's youngest son, was able to complete a portion of this machine and was able
                        to perform basic calculations.

                        <h2>The first laptop or portable computer</h2>

                        The IBM 5100 is the first portable computer, which was released on September 1975.
                        The computer weighed 55 pounds and had a five inch CRT display, tape drive,
                        1.9 MHz PALM processor, and 64 KB of RAM. In the picture is an ad of the IBM 5100
                        taken from a November 1975 issue of Scientific America.

                        The first truly portable computer or laptop is considered to be the Osborne I,
                        which was released on April 1981 and developed by Adam Osborne. The Osborne I weighed
                        24.5 pounds, had a 5-inch display, 64 KB of memory, two 5 1/4" floppy drives,
                        ran the CP/M 2.2 operating system, included a modem, and cost US$1,795.

                        The IBM PC Division (PCD) later released the IBM portable in 1984, its first portable
                        computer that weighed in at 30 pounds. Later in 1986, IBM PCD announced it's first laptop
                        computer, the PC Convertible, weighing 12 pounds. Finally, in 1994, IBM introduced
                        the IBM ThinkPad 775CD, the first notebook with an integrated CD-ROM.

                        In 1822, Charles Babbage conceptualized and began developing the Difference Engine,
                        considered to be the first automatic computing machine. The Difference Engine was capable
                        of computing several sets of numbers and making hard copies of the results.
                        Babbage received some help with development of the Difference Engine from Ada Lovelace,
                        considered by many to be the first computer programmer for her work and notes on
                        the Difference Engine. Unfortunately, because of funding, Babbage was never able
                        to complete a full-scale functional version of this machine. In June of 1991,
                        the London Science Museum completed the Difference Engine No 2 for the bicentennial
                        year of Babbage's birth and later completed the printing mechanism in 2000.

                        In 1837, Charles Babbage proposed the first general mechanical computer,
                        the Analytical Engine. The Analytical Engine contained an Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU),
                        basic flow control, punch cards (inspired by the Jacquard Loom), and integrated memory.
                        It is the first general-purpose computer concept. Unfortunately, because of funding issues,
                        this computer was also never built while Charles Babbage was alive. In 1910, Henry Babbage,
                        Charles Babbage's youngest son, was able to complete a portion of this machine and was able
                        to perform basic calculations.
